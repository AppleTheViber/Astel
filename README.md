# Astel Client



Astel is a [**Minecraft**](https://minecraft.net) private hacked client. Astel is written in 100% java (very based programming language). i intend for this project to be open source, open access, open development, and available to all for free sometime in the future, but for now it will remain private to only the few that are privlegged to access it.

# instructions
***the following instructions are for the latest version of Astel, this may change in the future***
-If you are lazy and are unaware the basics of coding then you may just download the precompiled release you can find on the right, however to do this 
you will need to have your antivirus off, and perhaps run as administrator. AGAIN if you do not trust it do not download it, no ones forcing you. The reason for this is that it takes from the base game already installed, which can classify as suspicious virus like activty to many antiviruses. you may comb through the source code if you would like, or even build it yourself.

**development**
